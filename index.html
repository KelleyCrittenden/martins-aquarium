                    <section class="tip">1. Place the Aquarium in the Ideal Location. The proper location of a saltwater aquarium can reduce the maintenance time. Your tank needs to be away from direct sunlight because it encourages algae growth, which means it will need to be cleaned more often. An algae-ridden tank can affect the health of your fish and obscure your view. Choose an area of the home that is well ventilated and has a cool temperature. Once set up, you won’t want the inconvenience of moving the tank. Make sure there are   electrical outlets close to the location of your tank.

                    <section class="tip">2. Choose the Right Tank Size
                        You may need to make a decision regarding the size of the tank once you determine the type and number of fish you want. It takes a while to get a tank established, so you should also ask yourself if you want to add more fish in the future. Having more room in the tank is better than having too little. It may be better to choose a larger tank and add fish once the tank is ready.

                    <br>
                    <section class="tip">3. Purchase a Good Stand.
                        Research the weight of your aquarium when filled with water and choose a stand accordingly. Remember, your tank will weigh roughly 10 pounds per gallon. Make sure the stand is large and sturdy enough to hold the weight.
                        
                        The experts at Aquatic Warehouse can advise you on the type of stand you might need, and they can also recommend the most important supplies for your tank,such as a filter or dosing pump.</section>
                        <br>
                    <section class="tip">4. Clean the tank before you fill      it. All it takes is a clean cloth and warm water to     clean the tank before adding the water and its          contents. Don’t use any chemical-based cleaners         because they could contaminate the water and kill       the fish.</section>
                         <br>   
                    <section class="tip">5. Rinse the gravel before adding     it. Using a sieve, rinse your gravel (unless the bag     is marked live sand) at least once before placing       it in the tank. Gravel is often dusty, and you          should get rid of as much of the dust as possible.      Plan for at least an inch-thick substrate in the        tank for fish tanks and two inches for freshwater       planted aquariums.Also, make sure you never use         table salt in your water, and avoid using water         straight from the tap due to chemicals that must be     neutralized.
